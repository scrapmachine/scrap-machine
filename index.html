<b>Mo Blue</b> is a Canadian, multidisciplinary artist and iconoclast whom bends time and dimension by way of sound. His new release under <b>Scrap Machine</b> entitled <i><b>Junk FM</b></i> unearths liminal space, and affords room to express and cleanse therein. <i>Work 1</i> and <i>Work 2</i> serve to deconstruct art-pop, and it illicits catharsis upon its listeners. <i>Work 3</i> is the act of tuning a station, tuning- or searching. <i>Work 4</i> explores the darker recess of emotion with audible sounds of wailing. <i>Work 5</i> and <i>Work 6</i> masterfully concludes <i>Junk FM's</i> voyage into the unknown with dissonance and western strums. Kick off your shoes, find ‘empty’ space and listen to <i>Junk FM</i>. - <b>Andra Durham</b>
